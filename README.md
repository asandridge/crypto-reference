# CryptoReference

A little project to improve my React.js and API interfacing skills.
# Run locally

Simply download the project and from the root directory run `npm run build && npm start`.

You will need your own Nomics key for the currency data, which you can request for free [here](https://p.nomics.com/cryptocurrency-bitcoin-api).

Put it in your `.env` under `REACT_APP_NOMICS_KEY`.
